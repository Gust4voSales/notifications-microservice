Notifications Microservice
</h1>

<p align="center">NestJS microservice for notifications developed during Ignite Lab 04 from @Rocketseat</p>

## ðŸ“œ About
This project was developed during IgniteLab 4 day course, even though the APP is very simple, the course focused a lot on building a microservice with attention to scalability by following high standard principles such as test-driven-development, clean and scalable code design.

The app allows users to:
 - Send notifications (it creates a notification instance in the DB, there's no actual notification system);
 - Read notification;
 - Unread notification;
 - Cancel a notification;
 - Get notifications from a recipient;
 - Count notifications from a recipient;
 - **Send notification when received Kafka messaging event**

If you want to test the API REST routes you can use Insomnia. Import the workspace with one click!

## ðŸ›  Getting started
1. Clone this repo running on your terminal ````git clone https://github.com/Gust4voSales/notifications-microservice.git```` 
2. Create a Kafka instance (Upstash free tier recommended) and add a "notifications.send-notification" topic (https://docs.upstash.com/kafka)

### &nbsp; &nbsp;Run NotificationsConsumer (main application)
3. `cd` into `notifications-consumer`
4. Run ```yarn``` to install all dependencies
5. Run migrations with `npx prisma migrate dev`
6. Create a .env file based on the .example.env and fill it in with Kafka connections' keys
7. Lastly, `yarn start:dev` to start the server

### &nbsp; &nbsp;Optionally run the producer script* 
3. `cd` into `notifications-producer`
4. Run ```yarn``` to install all dependencies
5. Create a .env file based on the .example.env and fill it in with Kafka connections' keys
6. `node producer.js` to run the script

*A script that generates a Kafka messaging event ("notifications.send-notification") to test the `notifications-consumer` app
